They had found a way to trigger a chain reaction beetwen atoms affected by fragmental split which at first seemed impossible. Then they had created this superweapon, Restart was the only project that used this new fragmental technology, it is almost a technological miracle, we would never be able to research it. But Bushark are inventors, they love new tech. Unfortunately, once you have destroyed everything here, we will not get new information but at least we will have an entire planet for ourselves.
